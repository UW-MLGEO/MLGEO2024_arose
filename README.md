## Notes on how to run Notebook

1. Clone and install repository
2. Run modules at start
3. Edit defined arrays to numbers wanted or input data for plotting
4. Function "plot()" plots distance [meters] vs. time [seconds] so you will use the function "plot(x,y)" where x is the time array and y is the distance covered.
5. It should output a plot with labeled x-axis, y-axis, and title for distance vs. time.
